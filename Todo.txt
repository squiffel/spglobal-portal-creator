My goal is to:


-- Logo
---- Each logo needs its own unique minimum size

-- Copy
---- Better font size settings by breakpoints
---- Description + CTA + Button
---- Character count limits

-- Layouts
---- Need to move the TEXT layout location to a column next to the logo rather than row above
---- Will need constraints on IMAGE POSITIONS so that the logo isn't tiny on super wide vertical shots. Don't let them do POSITION TOP

-- Styles
---- Seek & Prosper
---- CI Event
---- Podcast

-- Speakers*


Scope creep
-- Hide portal should be a separate toggle switch?
-- Make canvas size setting ONE line with two Input Boxes
-- I need to able to hide settings WHILE explaining why they are hidden
