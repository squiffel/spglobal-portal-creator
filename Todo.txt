Some built in Features

Automatic capitalization of divisions, products, countries
We can add character limits and warn people about bad practices

--------- Can fill the text boxes with crazy number of spaces
--------- FIT BY LARGEST LINE OF TEXT IS NOT THAT OBVIOUS, maybe make it a toggle. --- Auto-Font Resize
--------- AUTOMATED TEXT SIZE could be just fitting the text by one line
--------- CUSTOM TEXT SIZE COULD MAKE THE TEXT BALANCE VISIBLE AND FIT TO LONGEST LINE

-- Logo
---- Need to create custom breakpoints for determining logo size like I did for the fonts

-- Copy
---- If its one line, just based on one word
---- If the font size is over two lines ... auto-width based on longest line

---- HEADLINE Left DESCRIPTION Right (A design option that should exist)
---- Flag if the headline + copy is taking up almost no space. Aka the font is TINY for no reason.
---- Description + CTA + Button
---- Character count limits â€” Red warnings when over and cut off points super over.
---- Don't allow rescaling if it will make the text tiny in proportion to the available space
---------- HEADLINES should be 60-80 characters. Cap at 120?
---- Bottom aligned text, if the last line has no descenders then it is offset.
---- Font size on giant sizes like 1800x300 are still weird

-- Layouts
---- When the canvas is super wide, move the text to the right of the logo
---- If there is enough room like 1800x300 then the font size will need some work

-- Styles
---- Seek & Prosper
---- CI Event -- ADD EVENT NAME
---- Podcast

-- Speakers*


Scope creep
-- Hide portal should be a separate toggle switch?
-- Make canvas size setting ONE line with two Input Boxes
-- I need to able to hide settings WHILE explaining why they are hidden
