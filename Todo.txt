My goal is to:

-- Modify the MARGINS on super long skinny graphics to be bigger (+ add a minium of the & logo rule)


-- Copy
---- Align Text to BOTTOM? if the logo is above?
---- Add the ability to BREAK WORDS based on how its broken in the inputBox
---- Figure out the best way to determine the font size dynamically, do want to make this a control people can edit

-- Layouts
---- Need to move the TEXT layout location to a column next to the logo rather than row above
---- Will need constraints on IMAGE POSITIONS so that the logo isn't tiny on super wide vertical shots. Don't let them do POSITION TOP

-- Styles
---- Seek & Prosper
---- CI Event
---- Podcast

-- Speakers*

Hide portal should be a separate toggle switch?
