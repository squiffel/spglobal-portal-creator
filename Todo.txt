My goal is to:


-- Logo
---- Each logo needs its own unique minimum size

-- Copy
---- Need to prevent the word "S&P Global Market Intelligence" being split up on two lines if its in the copy.
--------- Maybe there is a function that shrinks the text to fit "Enginnering Solutions" on one line
---- Better font size settings by tailoring specific font sizes at specific breakpoints
---- Description + CTA + Button
---- Character count limits ? -- Maybe I just flag it like Twitter does. Red warning label

-- Layouts
---- When the canvas is super wide, move the text to the right of the logo

-- Styles
---- Seek & Prosper
---- CI Event -- ADD EVENT NAME
---- Podcast

-- Speakers*


Scope creep
-- Hide portal should be a separate toggle switch?
-- Make canvas size setting ONE line with two Input Boxes
-- I need to able to hide settings WHILE explaining why they are hidden
