Automatic capitalization of products and countries can be set
the regex is breaking it
let words = text.split(/((?:S&P Global)|\s+)/).filter((w) => w.trim().length > 0);

The text split is NO LONGER WORKING

-- Logo
---- Each logo needs its own unique minimum size

-- Copy
---- Need to prevent the word "S&P Global Market Intelligence" being split up on two lines if its in the copy.
--------- Maybe there is a function that shrinks the text to fit "Enginnering Solutions" on one line
---- Better font size settings by tailoring specific font sizes at specific breakpoints
---- Description + CTA + Button
---- Character count limits ? -- Maybe I just flag it like Twitter does. Red warning label
---0 N

-- Layouts
---- When the canvas is super wide, move the text to the right of the logo

-- Styles
---- Seek & Prosper
---- CI Event -- ADD EVENT NAME
---- Podcast

-- Speakers*
