My goal is to:

-- Modify the MARGINS on super long skinny graphics to be bigger (+ add a minium of the & logo rule)

-- Ability to HIDE logo when its FULL SCREEN IMAGE
-- FULL SCREEN WHITE BACKGROND -- CHANGE LOGO TO FULL BLACK
---- Add toggle switch to REVERSE (WHITE if Black, Black if white)


-- Copy
-- Layouts
-- Logo size (Based on MARGIN size?)

-- Styles
---- Seek & Prosper
---- CI Event
---- Podcast

-- Speakers*

Hide portal should be a separate toggle switch?
